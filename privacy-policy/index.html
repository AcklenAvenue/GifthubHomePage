                        <h3>Introduction</h3>
                        <p>
                            Acklen Avenue, LLC ("Company" or "We") respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it through our compliance with this policy.

                        <p>
                            This policy applies only to information we collect in this App and in e-mail, text and other electronic communications sent through or in connection with this App. This policy DOES NOT apply to information that we collect offline or on any other Company apps or websites, including websites you may access through this App. Third Party websites may have their own privacy policies, which we encourage you to read before providing information on or through them.
                        </p>

                            Please read this policy carefully to understand our policies and practices regarding your information and how we will treat it. If you do not agree with our policies and practices, do not download, register with or use this App. By downloading, registering with or using this App, you agree to this privacy policy. This policy may change from time to time. Your continued use of this App after we make changes is deemed to be acceptance of those changes, so please check the policy periodically for updates.

                        </p>
                        <h3>Information We Collect and How We Collect It</h3>
                        <p>
                            We collect information from and about users of our App, either (i) directly from you when you provide it to us or (ii) automatically when you use the App. When you download, register with or use this App, we may ask you provide information by which you may be personally identified, such as name, email address, individually identifiable username and password.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You may provide information to be published or displayed ("Posted") on public areas of websites you access through the App (collectively, "User Contributions"). Your User Contributions are Posted and transmitted to others at your own risk. Although you may set certain privacy settings for such information by logging into your account profile, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. Additionally, we cannot control the actions of third parties with whom you may choose to share your User Contributions. Therefore, we cannot and do not guarantee that your User Contributions will not be viewed by unauthorized persons.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We may automatically collect information that includes: (i) your usage of the app, for example, when you access and use the App; (ii) information about your mobile device and internet connection, including the device's unique device identifier, IP address, browser type, mobile network information and the device's telephone number; (iii)  metadata and other information associated with other files stored on your device, which may include, for example, photographs, audio and video clips, personal contacts and address book information; and (iv)  real-time information about the location of your device.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We may use mobile cookies or web beacons to automatically collect information. A cookie is a small file placed on your smartphone. It may be possible to refuse to accept mobile cookies by activating the appropriate settings on your smartphone. However, if you select this setting you may be unable to access certain parts of our App. With respect to web beacons, pages of the App may contain small electronic files known as web beacons (also referred to as clear gifs, pixel tags and single-pixel gifs) that permit the Company, for example, to count users who have visited those pages and for other related app statistics (for example, recording the popularity of certain app content and verifying system and server integrity).
                        </p>
                        <h3>Third-party Information Collection</h3>
                        <p>
                            When you use the App or its content, certain third parties may use automatic information collection technologies to collect information about you or your device. These third parties may include: (i) advertisers, ad networks and ad servers; (ii) analytics companies; (iii) your mobile device manufacturer; and (iv) your mobile service provider.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            These third parties may use tracking technologies to collect information about our users. This may include information about users' use of this App and other apps and websites to serve them interested-based (behavioral) advertising. We do not control these third parties' tracking technologies or how they may be used.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We do not control third parties' collection or use of your information to serve interest-based advertising. However these third parties may provide you with ways to choose not to have your information collected or used in this way. You can opt out of receiving targeted ads from members of the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI") on the NAI's website. 
                        </p>
                        <h3>How We Use Your Information</h3>
                        <p>

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We may also use your information to contact you about our own and third parties' goods and services that may be of interest to you. If you do not want us to use your information in this way, please adjust your user preferences in your account profile.

                        <p>
                            •   Location Information. You can choose whether or not to allow the App to collect and use real-time information about your device's location. If you block the use of location information some parts of the App may then be inaccessible or not function properly.
                        </p>

                        </p>
                        <h3>Accessing and Correcting Your Personal Information</h3>

                            You may also send us an e-mail at info@acklenavenue.com to request access to, correct or delete any personal information that you have provided to us. We cannot delete your personal information except by also deleting your user account. We may not accommodate a request to change information if we believe the change would violate any law or legal requirement or cause the information to be incorrect.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you delete your User Contributions from the App, copies of your User Contributions may remain viewable in cached and archived pages, or might have been copied or stored by other App users.

                        <h3>Data Security</h3>
                        <p>
                            We have implemented measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration and disclosure. All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers behind firewalls. Any payment transactions will be encrypted.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of our App, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet and mobile platforms is not completely secure. Although we do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information transmitted through our App. Any transmission of personal information is at your own risk. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures we provide.
